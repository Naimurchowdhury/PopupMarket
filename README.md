Regional food pantries are instrumental in combating the hunger problem by serving food to neighbors in need and providing last-mile linkage. 
However, different operation hours of pantries on different days of the week create a gap between supply and demand. 
Pop-up markets/mobile pantries can play an important role in this regard by serving as temporary facilities to close the gap. 
In this study, we consider a foodbank and its affiliated pantry network and develop a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model to place the limited mobile pantries in order to minimize the overall unmet demand. 
We consider the logistics and time-window constraints of the pop-up markets. 
Using data from a regional food bank, we illustrate the result of the study, which can help decision-makers strategically schedule pop-up markets while also ensuring the accessibility of foods to people in need.
